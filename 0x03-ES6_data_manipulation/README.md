## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- How to use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays
- Typed arrays
- The Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures

## Requirements

- All files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `.js` extension
- Your code will be tested using Jest and the command `npm run test`
- Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint
- Your code needs to pass all the tests and lint. You can verify the entire project running `npm run full-test`
- All functions must be exported

## Setup

### Install NodeJS 12.11.x

Run the following commands in your home directory:
